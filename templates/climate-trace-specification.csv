start_date,Yes,,1,"The start time using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of emissions, as a single point in time. In case no exact time is available, or in case the emissions pertain to a period of time, the date/time can be right truncated i.e. all of these are valid times: 2008-01-23T19:23:10+00:00; 2008-01-23T19:23:10; 2008-01-23; 2008-01; 2008; Except: 2008-01; 2008 all are ISO8601 compliant. If end_time is omitted, time is understood to cover the duration of the period defined by start_time. For example, if start_time is 2008-01 and end_time is omitted, then the time is understood to cover the entire month of January, 2008.",date and time or interval,{timestamp},1/1/18
end_date,Yes,,2,"The end time, inclusive, using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of emissions, as a single point in time. Follows format of ""start_time"". May be omitted. See ""start_time"" definition.",,{timestamp},12/31/18
iso3_country,Yes,,3,"Name of the person or organization who did the reporting. When possible, use standard abbreviations. Use ""_"" instead of spaces. e.g. climate_trace, EDGAR, CAIT, PIK",company or organization name,{iso3_country},FRA
CO2_emissions_tonnes,Yes,,4,"Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions values for that specific country on specific year in tonnes. Please note, ""0"" values are for true non-existant emissions. If we know that the sector has emissions for that specifc gas but the gas was not modeled please have ""NULL / none / nan"" representing an empty object.",quantity of GHG emissions,[{float}|NULL],2000
CH4_emissions_tonnes,Yes,,5,"Quanty of product emitted (without units) or NA if known to be not applicable, e.g. a country has no oil and gas. If reported quantity is zero, but some true emissions are expected, enter ""Yes"" for  unfccc_annex_1_category_is_subset, ""0"" for unfccc_annex_1_category_subset_fraction, and describe why in unfccc_annex_1_category_subset_estimation_method.",quantity of GHG emissions,[{float}|NULL],2000
N2O_emissions_tonnes,Yes,,6,"Quanty of product emitted (without units) or NA if known to be not applicable, e.g. a country has no oil and gas. If reported quantity is zero, but some true emissions are expected, enter ""Yes"" for  unfccc_annex_1_category_is_subset, ""0"" for unfccc_annex_1_category_subset_fraction, and describe why in unfccc_annex_1_category_subset_estimation_method.",quantity of GHG emissions,[{float}|NULL],2000
total_CO2e_100yrGWP,Yes,,7,"Corresponds to the total CO2e emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions. Climate TRACE uses IPCC AR6 CO2e GWPs. For CO2e convertion guidelines, please follow the CO2e 100yr & 20yr GWP Notion Page instructions.",,[{float}|NULL],2000
total_CO2e_20yrGWP,Yes,,8,"Corresponds to the total CO2e emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions. Climate TRACE uses IPCC AR6 CO2e GWPs. For CO2e convertion guidelines, please follow the CO2e 100yr & 20yr GWP Notion Page instructions.",,[{float}|NULL],2000
